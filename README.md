Listen. 

Emile Jacques-Dalcroze recognized that music is movement. 
Rhythm is everywhere down to the beat of our walk -  a regular pulse of left right left right. 

When we take a step and swing our body onto one foot, we are unbalanced, about to fall... 
Rhythm is a loss of equilibrium. We put down the other foot to catch the torso. Then we lose balance on the other sideâ€¦ 

Clap, conduct, skip, stretch, sway, twist, use the body as an instrument in itself. 
Your movements can start to feel like new words in a musical language, explaining things you didn't get before.

Play a piece of music. Now expressively walk that piece of music across the room.
Was that the most awesome walk? How can you change it to be more awesome?

Now play to match the way you were moving.
Music is always going forward, with feeling.

Your entire body is your primary instrument. 
Learning is fun.
